        Searching is of course the main reason for using Opensearch or Elasticsearch. Kt-search supports this
        with a rich Kotlin DSL.
        
        The advantage of using a Kotlin DSL for writing your queries is that you can rely on Kotlin's type safety
        and also use things like refactoring, property references to fields in your model classes, functional programming,
        etc.

            Of course normally, you'd specify some kind of query. One valid way is to simply pass that as a string.
            Kotlin of course has multiline strings that can be templated as well. So, this may be all you need.

            The `client.search` function takes a block that has a `SearchDSL` object as its receiver. You can use this to customize
            your query and add e.g. sorting, aggregations, queries, paging, etc.  
            
            The following sections describe (most) of the query dsl:

            - ${ManualPages.TermLevelQueries.page.mdLink}

            - ${ManualPages.Aggregations.page.mdLink}
            - ${ManualPages.DeepPaging.page.mdLink}
            
            Most commonly used query types are supported
            and anything that isn't supported, you can still add by using the map functionality.          
            For example, this is how you would construct the term query using the underlying map:
        """.trimIndent()
        example {

                Of course a key reason for querying is to get the documents you indexed back and 
                deserializing those back to your model classes so that you can do things with them.

                By default, the source gets deserialized as a `JsonObject`. However, with `kotlinx.serialization`, you can

                data structure. This is something we use in multiple places and it gives us the flexibility to
                be schema less when we need to and use a rich model when want to.

            of the body is a json object. Likewise, the response is in ndjson form and contains a search response
            for each of the search requests.
