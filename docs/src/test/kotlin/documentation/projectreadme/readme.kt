            ### Create a client
            
            We start by creating a client: 
        """.trimIndent()

        // this is what we show in the Readme :-)

            Kotlin has default values for parameters. So, we use sensible defaults for the 
            `host` and `port` parameters to connect to `localhost` and `9200`. But of 
            course you can modify those:
        """.trimIndent()
        example {
            val client = SearchClient(

            )
        }

        +"""
            If you need to, you can also configure multiple hosts, 
            add ssl and basic authentication to connect to managed Opensearch or Elasticsearch clusters. If you use
            multiple hosts, you can also configure a strategy for selecting the host to connect to. And of course 
            you can completely customize how the client connects.

            this, read the [manual](${ManualPages.GettingStarted.publicLink}).

            ### Documents and data classes
            
            In Kotlin, the preferred way to deal with data would be a data class. This is a simple data class
            that we will use as an example below.
        """.trimIndent()

        example {
            @Serializable
            data class TestDocument(
                val name: String,
                val tags: List<String>? = null
            )
        }

        +"""
            In the example below we will use this `TestDocument`, which we can serialize using the 
            [kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) 
            framework. 
            
            **Note**, the client provides a lot of flexibility including to your choice of JSON serialization. The only
            part of the code dependent on kotlinx serialization is the client module. But for example the Search DSL 
             and the other DSLs are not actually dependent on this.
             
            Additionally, if you choose to use the `IndexRepository`, it comes with a ModelSerialization strategy
            that abstracts how to parse/serialize your model classes. A kotlinx serialization implementation is included
            but that's easily swapped out for something else. So, if you need to use e.g. 
            jackson or gson instead, you can do so easily. However, kotlinx serialization is of course the only thing
            that works on multiplatform.
            
            ### Creating an index
                       
            Before we can query for `TestDocument` documents, we need to create an index and store some objects:
            
        """.trimIndent()
        val indexName = "readme-index"
        runBlocking {  runCatching { client.deleteIndex(target = indexName, ignoreUnavailable = true) } }

        example {
            val indexName = "readme-index"

            // create an index and use our mappings dsl
            client.createIndex(indexName) {
                settings {
                    replicas = 0
                    shards = 3
                    refreshInterval = 10.seconds
                }
                mappings(dynamicEnabled = false) {
                    text(TestDocument::name)
                    keyword(TestDocument::tags)
                }
            }
        }

        +"""
            This creates the index and uses the **mappings and settings DSL**. With this DSL, you can map fields, 
            configure analyzers, etc. This is optional of course; you can just call it without the block 
            and use the defaults and rely on dynamic mapping. 
            You can read more about that [here](${ManualPages.IndexManagement.publicLink}) 
            
            ### Adding documents
            
            To fill the index with some documents, we need to use bulk indexing operations.
            
            In kt-search this is made very easy with a **Bulk Indexing DSL** that completely abstracts away the book keeping
            that you need to do for this in other clients. 
            
            The bulk block below creates a `BulkSession`, which does this for you and flushes
            operations to Elasticsearch. You can configure and tailor how this works via parameters
            that have sensible defaults. For example the number of operations that is flushed is something
            that you'd want to probably configure and error handling is something you can customize as well.
            
            The optional `refresh` parameter uses WaitFor as the default. This means that after the block exits, the documents
            will have been indexed and are available for searching. 
        """.trimIndent()
        example {
            client.bulk(
                refresh = Refresh.WaitFor,
                // send operations every 2 ops
                // default and more sensible would be 100
                bulkSize = 2,
            ) {
                index(
                    doc = TestDocument(
                        name = "apple",
                        tags = listOf("fruit")
                    ),
                    index = indexName
                )
                index(
                    doc = TestDocument(
                        name = "orange",
                        tags = listOf("fruit", "citrus")
                    ),
                    index = indexName,
                )
                index(
                    // you can also provide raw json
                    // but it has to be a single line in the bulk request
                    source =
                    """{"name":"banana","tags":["fruit","tropical"]}""",
                    index = indexName
                )
            }

            [bulk operations](${ManualPages.BulkIndexing.publicLink}) and how to customize it in the manual.
            
            ### Search
            
            Now that we have some documents in an index, we can do some queries:
        """.trimIndent()
        example {
            // search for some fruit
            val results = client.search(indexName) {
                // `this` is a SearchDSL instance in the block
                query = bool {
                    must(
                        term("tags", "fruit"),
                        // note how we can also use property references here
                        matchPhrasePrefix(TestDocument::name, "app")
                    )
                }
            }

            println("found ${results.total} hits")
            results
                // extension function that deserializes
                // the hits using kotlinx.serialization
                .parseHits<TestDocument>()
                .first()
                .let {
                    // we feel lucky
                    println("doc ${it.name}")
                }
            // you can also get the JsonObject if you don't
            // have a model class
            println(results.hits?.hits?.first()?.source)
        }.printStdOut(this)

        +"""
            You can also construct complex aggregations with the query DSL.
            Aggregation queries are one of the more complex topics in Elasticsearch
            and we worked hard to make constructing these programmatically from
            Kotlin as easy as possible.
        """.trimIndent()
        example {
            val resp = client.search(indexName) {
                // we don't care about retrieving hits
                resultSize = 0
                agg("by-tag", TermsAgg(TestDocument::tags) {
                    // simple terms agg on the tags field
                    aggSize = 50
                    minDocCount = 1
                })
            }
            // Despite aggregations JSON being very complicated,
            // kt-search makes picking the results apart easy.
            resp.aggregations
                .termsResult("by-tag")
                .parsedBuckets.forEach { bucket ->
                    println("${bucket.parsed.key}: ${bucket.parsed.docCount}")
                }
        }.printStdOut(this)

            These examples show off a few nice features of this library:
            
            - Kotlin DSLs are nice, type safe, and easier to read and write than pure Json. And of course
            you get auto completion too. The client includes more DSLs for searching, creating indices and mappings, datastreams, 
            index life cycle management, bulk operations, aggregations, and more. All this builds on 
            [JsonDSL](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/json-dsl), which is a library we created for easily creating
            Kotlin DSLs for existing JSON dialects.
            - Where in JSON, you use a lot of String literals, kt-search actually allows you to use
             property references or enum values as well. If you use those, refactoring your data model doesn't 
             break your mappings and queries.
            - Kt-search makes complicated features like bulk operations, aggregations, etc. really easy 
            to use and accessible. And there is also the `IndexRepository`, which makes it extremely easy
            to work with and query documents in a given index or data stream.
            - While a Kotlin DSL is nice to have, sometimes it just doesn't have the feature you 
            need or maybe you want to work with raw json and use Kotlin's multiline string literals. 
            Kt-search allows you to do both and mix schema less with type safe kotlin. You can easily add custom 
            properties to the DSL via a simple `put`. All `JsonDsl` are actually mutable maps.  
            - Kt-search is designed to be [extensible](${ManualPages.ExtendingTheDSL.publicLink}). 
            It's easy to use the built in features. And you can easily add your own features. This also
            works for plugins or new features that Elasticsearch or Opensearch add.
