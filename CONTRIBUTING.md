Pull requests are welcome generally. Also, filing issues, doing documentation, or providing general feedback, etc. is much appreciated.

Before starting on any big pull requests, please file an issue and/or ping me on @jillesvangurp on twitter or several other platforms where I go by the same handle. This is so we can avoid conflicts/disappointment and coordinate changes. Especially for API changes, big refactorings, etc.

I try to be responsive processing PRs and critical issues. Otherwise, I have to balance working on this with other stuff so I may not respond right away. If this blocks you, reach out on twitter or via email jilles AT jillesvangurp.com so we can resolve things.

Where possible, please stick with conventions visible in the code for naming things, formatting things, etc. Generally, use extension functions amd other mechanisms whereever possible.

As this is a multiplatform library, please be careful adding dependencies; especially platform specific ones.

Generally for new features, please also consider adding some text to the manual on how to use it. I'm trying to keep that in sync with all the features implemented. Also, it kind of doubles as a simple test suite that ensures the features documented at least work somewhat.
